1: remove user_id from request body in almost all cases
    - it should be in the path already

2: figure out why the repository methods that call db.query are considered null but still work
    - LSP problems? or actual risk of null?
    - it's driving me insane, makes it difficult to see if something actually is wrong

3: update yuml diagram to most up-to-date version
    - set up github action that automatically generates a new image based on yuml-file?

4: fix style of all files
    - pep-8? some sort of linting is required...

5: separate controller from services
    - populate the service directory

6: separate controller domains
    - NoteController | UserController

7: separate repository domains
    - NoteRepository | UserRepository
