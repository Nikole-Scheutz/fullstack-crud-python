1: move gunicorn files into ./backend_config/, or into backend/config/
    - fix on actual server
    - make a script that puts each file in the correct place?
        - big script, would need tons of user configuration
          unfeasible? not sure...

2: figure out how to separate more nginx servers/routes into separate files
    - better way than this... symlink into correct places?
    - document symlinks
        - document everything...
        - add readme, should maybe be first..

3: remove user_id from request body in almost all cases
    - it should be in the path already

X 4: figure out why the repository methods that call db.query are considered null but still work
    X- LSP problems? or actual risk of null?
    X- it's driving me insane, makes it difficult to see if something actually is wrong
    SOLUTION - install `sqlalchemy-stubs` library
        - next problem: different part of repository method is screaming
        SOLUTION - f-string the keys of the update methods
            ADDENDUM - that was not the case, just put the key names as string fixes it

5: update yuml diagram to most up-to-date version
    - set up github action that automatically generates a new image based on yuml-file?

6: fix style of all files
    - pep-8? some sort of linting is required...

X 7: separate controller from services
    - populate the service directory

8: separate controller domains
    - NoteController | UserController

9: separate repository domains
    - NoteRepository | UserRepository
